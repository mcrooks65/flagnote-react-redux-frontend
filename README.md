# FlagNote (React-Redux)

The purpose of this application is to provide easy note-taking and suggestions when doing Capture the Flag hacking events or simple pentesting.

As opposed to just a blank notepad, FlagNote is designed to suggest activities to the user and help complete a given ctf event or pentest faster.  

These suggestions can be as simple as checklists, commands to try, or links to info on particular topics etc.

## Installation

The FlagNote application requires a working rails backend, found here: https://github.com/mcrooks65/flagnote-rails-backend

## Usage

After setting up the backend API (see link above), you can run the client-side application with 'npm start'
